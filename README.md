![ProcessPurge Logo](logo.png)

A lightweight and powerful Windows utility designed to help you quickly terminate unnecessary applications and free up system resources.

## Download

The latest installer can be found on the **[Releases page](https://github.com/PrudentPotato/ProcessPurge/releases)**.

## Key Features

* **Comprehensive Process List:** View all currently running processes on your system.
* **Advanced Sorting:** Sort the process list by name, memory usage, CPU usage, or selection status.
* **Flexible CPU Monitoring:**
    * **Total CPU Time (Default):** A fast, non-intensive view of the total processor time used by an application since it started.
    * **Live CPU % (Optional):** Enable in settings to see a live percentage of CPU usage, similar to Task Manager (this requires more resources and slows down the refresh).
* **Customizable Purge List:** Select specific processes to add to a "Termination Order" list.
* **Ordered Termination:** Arrange the processes in your purge list in the exact order you want them to be terminated.
* **System Tray Integration:** Runs quietly in the system tray for quick access. Right-click to instantly purge processes, open the main window, or access settings.
* **Safety Features:**
    * **Critical Process Protection (Default):** Prevents you from accidentally selecting essential Windows system processes. This can be disabled by advanced users.
    * **Confirmation Dialog:** A confirmation prompt appears before purging from the main window to prevent accidental clicks.
* **Persistent Settings:** Your custom purge list and all your settings are automatically saved and reloaded every time you start the application.
* **Automatic Startup:** Configure ProcessPurge to start automatically and silently with Windows.
